https://youtu.be/50FBrcqoB-M

**[Event Single Page Builder](https://eventscalendaraddons.com/plugin/event-single-page-builder-pro/?utm_source=epta_plugin&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=get_pro&utm_content=top_description)** is a powerful addon for The Events Calendar Plugin that allows you to design a single event page.

Instead of relying on the default event layout offered by The Events Calendar, this addon gives multiple layout options, allowing you to design event pages according to your website.

### Key Features
* **Display Events:** Choose where you want the single event template to be applied. You can select to display it on all events or specific ones according to your preferences.
* **Event Templates:** Choose a pre-built template layout for your single event page.
* **Date Format:** Easily customize how dates should be displayed by choosing from various formats.
* **Events Page Slug:** Enter the URL slug for your all-events listing page. This helps in linking back to your events from individual event pages.
* **Primary Color:** Set the main background color, typically used for headings or highlighted sections on the single event layout.
* **Custom CSS:** Add your own CSS code to customize the appearance of your single event page.
